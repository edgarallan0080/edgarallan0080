- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible! Honey's long shelf life is due to its low moisture content and acidic pH, which create an inhospitable environment for bacteria and microorganisms. Sweet, right?
